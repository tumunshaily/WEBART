## ABOUT

Star editing by drag and drop an image from your computer. Draw on the image, crop, resize it and save the edited image to your computer.
Users can select to draw over the image using either predefined shapes like circles, rectangles, lines or to draw freely. Change the image size with the posibility to keep the ratio or simply crop it to get rid of unwanted areas. Add image filters like Grayscale, Threshold, Sephia or Invert Colors.
